## Boston House Price prediction
This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using the Boston dataset by using machine learning techniques.

## Project overview
- The analysis and modeling are done in a notebook ("housingBoston.ipynb") created and run in **Google Colab**.
- The dataset used is "HousingData.csv", containing housing features and prices for Boston area houses.

## Contents

- "housingBoston.ipynb" — The Google Colab notebook with data loading, exploration, visualization, and modeling steps.
- "HousingData.csv" — The dataset file.
- "README.md" — This project summary.

## Challenges
Missing value treatment
Outlier treatment
Understanding which variables drive the price of homes in Boston

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
- JIRA for Agile task tracking
- Google Colab
- GitHub

 ## Tasks Tracked in JIRA
- Import dataset
- Handle missing values
- Handle outliers
- Data visualization
- Train/test split
- Build and evaluate regression model
- Save model
- Push final project to GitHub
