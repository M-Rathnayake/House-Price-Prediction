## Boston House Price prediction
This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using the Boston dataset by using machine learning techniques.

## Project overview
- The analysis and modeling are done in a notebook ("housingBoston.ipynb") created and run in **Google Colab**.
- The dataset used is "HousingData.csv", containing housing features and prices for Boston area houses.

## Contents

- "housingBoston.ipynb" — The Google Colab notebook with data loading, exploration, visualization, and modeling steps.
- "HousingData.csv" — The dataset file.
- "README.md" — This project summary.

## Challenges

Missing value treatment
Outlier treatment
Understanding which variables drive the price of homes in Boston

## Summary of data set
The Boston housing dataset contains 506 observations and 14 variables. The dataset contains missing values.
The dataset is the Boston Housing dataset, originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and widely used in regression modeling tutorials.
